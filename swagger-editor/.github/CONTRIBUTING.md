### Frequent Issues

**Generated code is not working.**
Report it in [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) repository

**I see "Code Generation Server is not availabe"**
Either codegen servers are down or [your config](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/6dd09e5886c414801fd6eea3bb86bd2a3643c249/config/defaults.json.guide.js#L31) is pointing to an invalid loccation

**`OPTIONS` call is failing**
See [CORS document](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.md)

**How do I store my spec?**
Swagger Editor does not have a backend.

**I can't start Swagger Editor**
You rarely would need to build Swagger Editor from source. Use one of methods described in README to start a new instance of Swagger Editor.
